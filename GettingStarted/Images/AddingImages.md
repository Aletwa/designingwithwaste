### Adding Images 

Adding images to a GitHub repository is a lot like adding images to an Adobe document. The main difference is that you will need to manually create the link between your document and image.

1. Create a folder where all of your images will live.
2. Upload images to the folder
3. Link to those images in your markdown files (documents that have the .md extension)

### Creating a Folder

3. In the file path, type in the name of your new folder. It should end with "/". Ex: "NewFolder/".
4. As soon as you type the backslash, the folder will become part of the file path and you will see a new textbox where you can add a new file. Type in a file name.

8. Drag and drop your files into the browser or click on "choose your files" to add your photos.

**GitHub can display images in the following formats: PNG, JPG, GIF, PSD, and SVG**

### Linking your Images

1. Open your desired file and click the edit icon. Images will only appear in markdown files (files that end in ".md".
2. Enter the following code in your desired location: ![alt text that will appear to screenreaders](URL for your image)

**Ex:** `![gif illustrating steps 3 and 4](https://github.com/designingwithwaste/designingwithwaste/blob/main/GettingStarted/Images/HowToAddFolder3.gif)`

**Tip:** Remember that you can always click on the "Raw" button in this or any other GitHub document to see the markdown code for the document. This will let you see how that document was created. In this case, that means you will see how image files were added to the document.
