# Welcome to the Designing With Waste Repository! 

**In this repository you will find:**
- open source/creative commons licensed resources for making things using waste materials
- materials to help you get started engaging in circular economies
- free recipes for creating materials
- troubleshooting guides
- lists of failed experiments
- a group of makers dedicated to collaborating on and making materials that help us lessen our negative environmental impact

This repository welcomes anyone who is interested in using waste materials to create new materials. The purpose is to foster collaboration so that together we can come up with solutions to overconsumption and disposability. Design can’t save the world by itself, but since design touches on so many aspects of the human experience, it can make an impact. As designers and makers of all stripes, we must strive to work more responsibly, to lower our negative impact on the planet. Reducing our consumption of virgin materials while helping waste materials find new lives is a way to go about doing that. By working together on these issues, we can create more thoughtful change. So please, feel free to lurk here, but also know that you’re always welcome to leave a comment, ask questions, and you’re especially welcome to contribute to the recipes in this repository. Test them out, make suggestions on recipe improvements, clone the recipes and make them your own, clone this template and contribute your own recipes. Let’s make change together.

### How to use the Designing With Waste GitHub Repository

The easiest way to use this repository is to look through the documentation here. But if you want to join our community, you’ll need to create a GitHub account. Then, familiarize yourself with some GitHub basics. GitHub was created for programmers to share and collaborate on code. 

**Here is a list of translations, from GitHub programming speak to design and making speak:**
- Repository = works similarly (but more robustly) to a collaborative folder or drive on Google Drive or Office 365, where the main content is presented in documents and anyone who has access to the folder or drive can speak to other users through comments and suggestions
- Clone = a copy of a repository that exists separately from the original repository, the clone is not linked to the original and you cannot pull down changes from the original to your clone
- Branch = a repository is made up of branches that, like on a tree, branch off from one another
- Main Branch = the original branch of a repository (analogous to the trunk of tree)
- Fork = the act of cloning a GitHub repository in order to make a new branch, changes made to clones will not affect the original repository or branch from which the new branch was forked/cloned, new branches are linked to the previous branches in the repository, forking instead of cloning means that you will be able to send pull requests to the original branch

**Here is some information about the basic tabs and buttons found in GitHub:**
- Code = the tab in a GitHub repository where a programmer normally stores their code, but where we will store our materials recipes
- Pull Requests = a request to update the documentation/information in a branch, requests are made by users like you when they have a suggestion that they would like to see reflected in a branch’s documentation, the term pull request is used because the creator of the branch pulls the requested change into the branch
- Discussions = the tab in a GitHub repository where you can chat with others about the branch’s contents, the information in discussions is not meant to be pulled into the branch’s documentation, but can be a great place to discuss possible changes, ask questions, share what you’re working on, and send the branch’s creator some appreciation for their work
- Actions = the actions tab shows a list of all the major things that have happened in a branch, such as pull requests that have been accepted

### How to find information in the GitHub repository

Right now, you are reading the ReadMe.md file in the Designing With Waste GitHub repository. This is one file in the main branch of the repository. Just like with a file for a photograph, the name and file extension of a branch’s document tell you what to expect. For example, a photo may be titled “selfie.jpg”, telling you the subject of the file and that it is a photograph in the jpg format. All files and folders in a branch should have a descriptive name, such as “Instructions.md”, which tells you that you can find the instructions for making the material in that document. The “md” extension tells you that the document will appear in markdown. Markdown is a language that makes coding appear as it does in a normal text document. That means that you will be able to see headers, lists, and other formatting options. The Designing With Waste repository is mainly made of markdown (md) files because it was created with visual creatives in mind. Since we are not using this space to share code but materials instructions, using markdown will make it easier for us to discuss and share our work.

The main branch of the Designing With Waste repository has been set up as a blank template. That was done to help make it easier for anyone to drop in information about their material recipes quickly and efficiently by copying the original branch and replacing any text that is between [brackets] with their own text. When forking a branch, adhering to the template layout is not required but is recommended. Following the layout means that users will know what to expect and where to find information when working with your branch. 

The template was set up with basic file keeping maintenance in mind. Just like when you’re working with an Adobe or Keyshot file, keep all your material organized in folders. And do not title documents “final”. For example, in the “Tests” folder you should be able to find records of the tests that a branch creator has made. Those records can be organized depending on the needs of the branch, with all the tests in one tests document, spread out into multiple folders and documents organized according to date, or organized depending on the type of test conducted. The tests documents in the “Tests” folder in this template are organized by the type of test conducted, so you will see documents titled “[Binder] Tests” and “[Main Ingredient] Tests”. If you have or are conducting a lot of tests, consider creating new sub-folders within the “Tests” folder for your different types of tests. Remember that the text between brackets is meant to be replaced with text that is appropriate for your project.

The “Failed Tests” file is important because many breakthroughs have been made because of supposed failures. Use your judgement as to what constitutes a failed test. And remember that by aggregating your failed tests, you and others may have an easier time realizing not just where mistakes were made but where opportunities lie. 

### Getting Acquainted with GitHub and learning Markdown

Learn how to use GitHub by following tutorials and seeing how the information in this repository is organized:

- [The GitHub Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github) will walk you through the basics of using GitHub. Its focus is on coding. 
- [Create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/pulls#create-a-pull-request)
- [How to edit files in a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/editing-files-in-your-repository)
- [How to add a folder to a in a repository](https://github.community/t/add-a-folder/2304)
- [How to fork a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
- [The Markdown guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
- [Markdown demo](http://markdown-it.github.io/), where you can practice typing in markdown 

When in a document, look at the upper right corner of the document (not the screen). Click the “raw” button to see the markdown coding. 

In this repository, headers H1, H3, and H4 are used, along with bolding and italicizing text. The visual difference between H1 and H2 headers is not very obvious, which is why H2 headers are not used. Bolding text is used as a header before lists, such as ingredients lists. Bolded text is also used to indicate waste materials in ingredients lists. Italicized text is used to indicate materials that have been altered in tests. Bolded italicized text in a test document indicates a material that is a waste material that has been altered. For example, 2c pasta water that has been bolded and italicized means that pasta water is a waste material and it has been altered in some way, such as the amount added differing from the original recipe. Follow these formatting conventions to help users identify useful information at a glance.


Now go forth, have fun, and be respectful!
