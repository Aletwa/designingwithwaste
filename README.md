# Welcome to the Designing With Waste Repository! 

**In this repository you will find:**
- open source/creative commons licensed resources for making things using waste materials
- materials to help you get started engaging in circular economies
- free material recipes
- troubleshooting guides
- lists of failed experiments
- a group of makers dedicated to collaborating on and making materials that help us lessen our negative environmental impact

This repository and **DesigningWithWaste.com** were started by Mari Miller, a maker who wants to share the materials she has developed as alternatives to plastic modeling materials. Everyone is welcome to join. Feel free to lurk, comment, propose recipe and documentatino updates, and add recipes of your own. While this repository is based on Mari's Cai Modeling Materials, feel free to use her documentation as templates for sharing your own material recipes and formulas. 

**About Cai Modeling Materials:**
This repository walks you through making biodegradable and recyclable alternatives to common plastic-based modeling and prototyping materials. Cai Board can be used in the place of extruded polystyrene foam (such as pink, blue, and REN foams) in most applications. Cai Clay is an air drying clay that can serve as an alternative to synthetic clays (such as Sculpey, Plasticine, and paper clay made with PVA glue) where you are focused more on form than detailed carving work. Both materials are made from waste paper. Cai Clay is also made from waste plaster.

These replacer materials were made with prototyping and model-making in mind. Designers have been making strides in producing products made from recycled materials, but the prototyping materials we use are often plastic-based virgin materials that are non-recyclable. Let’s not limit ourselves to manufacturing in closed-loop circular economy systems. Let’s make our creative processes circular and sustainable as well. 

**To make Cai Board, you will need:**
- blender (not to be used for making food)
- measuring spoons &/or a scale
- sponges & towels
- molds
- paper
- binder, such as kuzu
- fan
- safety equipment

**To make the plaster clay-replacer, you will need:**
- blender (not to be used for making food)
- measuring spoons &/or a scale
- sponges & towels
- paper
- plaster that has already been set
- CMC Cellulose
- mesh screen on a stand &/or plaster slab
- fan
- safety equipment

Once you have made your Cai Modeling Materials, you will want to sculpt them.  The following tools are discussed in the Gluing and Finishing sections. 
**Sculpt with these tools:**
- Cutting tools: saws, drills, routers and CNC machines
- Sanding paper and blocks
- Clay carving tools
- Biodegradable glue

This repository offers many tips. If you want to skip straight to making, go to the Basic Recipes, Paper Foam Instructions, Paper Foam Recipes, Paper Clay Instructions, and Paper Clay Recipes documents (see the list of dolcuments and folders at the top of this page).
