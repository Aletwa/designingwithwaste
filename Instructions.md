### Purpose of Material
[a paper-based modeling material that can replace extruded polystyrene]

#### Pros:
[cheaper, reduces plastic consumption and the amount of paper and plastic that gets thrown into landfills, you won't be breathing in as many microplastics]

#### Cons: 
[heavier than a lot of modeling foams, can't be cut on a hot wire]

#### Sourcing the Waste Material(s): 
[This recipe uses waste paper, which is readily and easily available- junk mail is a great source. Just make sure you remove any staples, tape, or plastic-based glues]

#### Potential Safety Issues: 
[like with all materials that produce dust, such as wood and foam, make sure you always wear a dust mask or resporator when carving your board. Keep in mind that if you use binders like pasta water made from wheat pasta, some people may have allergic reactions to your material.]

### Recipe

#### Ingredients, waste materials **bolded**:
- [**4 sheets of US sized computer paper**]
- [about 300mL water]
- [1tsp binder]

#### Equipment
- [blender]
- [molds]
- [towels and sponges]

#### Time:
- [5-20min to make depending on batch size]
- [6hr-days to dry depending on fans, humidity, and temperature]
- [15min-hr to sculpt]

#### Instructions:
1. [Blend ingredients]
2. [Mold ingredients]
3. [Sculpt]

#### Tips:
[Press the edges of the pulp down where it meets the sides of the mold to reduce the amount of flashing.]

#### Opportunities for experimentation:
[Binders made from invasive species could be a great way to reduce the harm caused by using virgin materials.]

#### Questions for the community:
[I don't have access to a hydraulic press and would love to see if anyone has testing compressing this material on a press like that.]
